Project Title: NBA Player Comparison

Authors: Jonathan Sy and Daniel Chukhlebov

Project Description:
The goal of this project is to compare two NBA players. More specifically, it will compare the two player's stats when they are both playing and when each of them is not playing. This will allow users to separate how well each player plays when the other is not on the court for fantasy basketball. One use case of this is when a starting player gets hurt. Using this application, a user can see how well the backup player plays when the starter is not playing to see if they are worth rostering or not.
